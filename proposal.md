# MENTORS

Mentors with email addresses and link ids:

Yihui Xie (xie@yihui.name; yihui), Shangxuan Zhang (shangxuan_zhang@brown.edu; casunlight)

## Have you been in touch with the mentors? When and how?

Yes. I have been in touch with the mentors via email since January 19th, we discussed a lot about the plans and goals of this project.

# CODING PLAN & METHODS

## Main steps:



## Timeline:



## Perceived obstacles and critical objectives:

The second part of our project is not hard to handle, however it may be a little time-consuming. If so, we can just choose one website to rewrite and generate dynamic reports.

The third part is depended on RGoogleDocs or pandocs, consequently, it is verytroublesome if these two packages have fatal bugs that related to this project.

# MANAGEMENT OF CODING PROJECT

## What is the communication plan with mentors?

I will communicate with mentors via email frequently; actually, I have been in touch with the mentors via email about the project since January 19th.

## How do you propose to ensure code is submitted / tested?

The homepage of knitr is here: https://github.com/yihui/knitr , I will submit my code via GIT. It is very easy to testing code since our target is getting dynamic report in the web. For example, the code can be tested via the second part: if there is something wrong in the code, then we cannot get the expected web pages.

## What is your contigency plan for things not going to schedule?

The first part's job is the core in this project.

If I find that the time is not going to schedule in the first or second part, I will reduce the second part's time: just choose one website to rewrite and generate dynamic reports.

If I find that the time is not going to schedule in the third part, I will just choose one method after simple comparing.
